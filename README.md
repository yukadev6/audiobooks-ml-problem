This is a business case study and classification problem in machine learning. The task was to create a machine learning algorithm based on data from an Audiobook app that can predict if a customer will buy again from the Audiobook company. Included are files for the raw data, preprocessing the data, three Audiobooks datasets, and the ML algorithm. 

How to use and run the Jupyter Notebook files yourself:
1. Create a local folder in a location where the entire repo can be cloned.
2. Open terminal and navigate to that new folder (local repo)
3. Run this command in terminal: git clone https://github.com/yukadev6/audiobooks-ml-problem.git
4. Open Google Drive and upload the entire cloned local repo.
5. Open the Audiobooks_ML__preprocessing.ipynb and it will open in Google Colab.
6. Upload the Audiobooks_data.csv to the current session files and then under Runtime, select "Run all" and this will produce the three datasets as .npz files
7. Download the three datasets from the session files to the local repo to be used in the next step.
8. Open the Audiobooks_ML_algorithm.ipynb and upload the three datasets to the current session files.
9. Under Runtime, select "Run all"
